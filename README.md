Ever wondered why your favorite snacks are always in stock at some stores but missing in others? 🍪🛒 I used Power BI to uncover insights like these for Blinkit—find out what the data revealed!”

Hello everyone! 
I’m thrilled to unveil my latest Power BI dashboard project, diving deep into Blinkit’s extensive data to check Sales trends across items and outlets 
and Impact of outlet size and location on sales.

📌 Project Snapshot:
The Blinkit Grocery Dashboard aims to empower stakeholders with data-driven insights into grocery sales and customer preferences. This tool is designed to help optimize inventory, understand customer behavior, and make data-backed decisions to enhance the overall shopping experience.

Project Goals 🎯:
Analyze sales by item type and outlet.
Identify trends in visibility and fat content to boost sales.
Provide insights to improve sales and customer satisfaction.

🌟 Here’s My Approach:
Data Preparation: Transformed raw sales data from Blinkit into a clean, structured format, ready for Power BI integration.
Dashboard Creation: Developed a layered, user-friendly dashboard showcasing critical metrics, including total sales, product ratings, and outlet performance across various tiers.
Insightful Analysis: Identified customer trends, revealing that 64.6% of sales came from low-fat items—a key insight for focused marketing strategies!
Outlet Performance: Analyzed sales performance by tier, discovering that Tier 3 outlets led with a revenue of $472.13K.

Key features of the dashboard include:
➡️ Total & Average Sales Overview: Provides a quick view of total sales revenue, average sales per outlet, and total items sold across outlets, enabling an at-a-glance assessment of financial performance.

➡️ Product Category Sales: A bar chart illustrating sales contributions from various product categories like fruits, snacks, and household items, allowing for in-depth analysis by category.
➡️ Fat Content Sales Split: Breaks down sales by low-fat versus regular-fat items, giving insights into customer preference for healthier product choices.
➡️ Outlet Performance by Location & Size: Examines sales across Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 locations, as well as outlet size, to help identify top-performing areas and outlet types.
➡️ Outlet Type Performance Matrix: A comparative matrix displaying different outlet types (such as grocery stores and supermarkets), covering metrics like total sales, average ratings, product visibility, and inventory, allowing for performance benchmarking across outlet types.
